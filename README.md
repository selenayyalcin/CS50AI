## Week 0 - Search
Covered traditional algorithms for finding the most optimal or near-optimal paths between two points, aiming to minimize costs.

- Depth-First Search
- Breadth-First Search
- Greedy best-first search
- A * search
- MiniMax
- Alpha-Beta Pruning
- Depth-Limited Minimax

### Project 0a: Degrees
This project employs the breadth-first search algorithm to determine the "degrees of separation" between two actors, popularly known as the "Six degrees of Kevin Bacon."

### Project 0b: Tic-Tac-Toe
This project presents a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game with an AI opponent using the minimax algorithm to achieve an optimal strategy.
