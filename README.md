## Week 0 - Search
Covered traditional algorithms for finding the most optimal or near-optimal paths between two points, aiming to minimize costs.

- Depth-First Search
- Breadth-First Search
- Greedy best-first search
- A * search
- MiniMax
- Alpha-Beta Pruning
- Depth-Limited Minimax

### Project 0a: Degrees
This project employs the breadth-first search algorithm to determine the "degrees of separation" between two actors, popularly known as the "Six degrees of Kevin Bacon."

### Project 0b: Tic-Tac-Toe
This project presents a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game with an AI opponent using the minimax algorithm to achieve an optimal strategy.

## Week 1 - Knowledge
This module focuses on knowledge representation and logical reasoning, providing a structured approach for machines to comprehend and solve deductive problems algorithmically.

- Propositional Logic
- Inference
- Knowledge Engineering
- Inference Rules
- Resolution
- First Order Logic

### Project 1a: Knights
This project's task is to create an AI program for solving "Knights and Knaves" logic puzzles, where characters are either always truthful (knights) or always lying (knaves).

### Project 1b: Minesweeper
The project involves creating an AI capable of playing Minesweeper, a puzzle game where players avoid hidden mines while uncovering tiles.

## Week 2 - Uncertainty
Covers the basic principles of probability theory in AI, including conditional probability, random variables, and probability distributions. It also introduces concepts like entropy, Monte Carlo methods, and classifiers for handling uncertainty in AI.

- Probability
- Conditional Probability
- Bayesâ€™ Rule
- Joint Probability
- Probability Rules
- Bayesian Networks
- Sampling
- Markov Models
- Hidden Markov Models

### Project 2a: PageRank
This project implements an AI that ranks web pages using the Pagerank algorithm, which considers the number and quality of links pointing to a page.

### Project 2b: Heredity
The project predicts the likelihood of a child having a certain genetic trait based on their parents' traits, using Bayesian networks and conditional probability.
